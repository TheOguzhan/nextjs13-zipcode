# Example repo for Turkish zipcodes using nextjs app directory
## Techs used:
* Next.js 13 and RSC
* Sqlite3 or Postgresql
* PTT's csv was parsed with a golang project into a sqlite database and csv file for neon.tech database
* repo was made to understand nextjs 13 rsc's
* you might need to add postgresql DATABASE_URL in .env file or change the code a little bit to use local sqlite database
* P.S.:Vercel doesn't support the second part
